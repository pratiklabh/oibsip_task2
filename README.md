Number Guessing game
This is the demo of the second task (Number Guessing game) as part of Oasis Infobyte internship program. The system generates a random number between 1 to 100. The user is prompted to enter their given number in input box. The system then tells if the entered number matches the guesses number or it is higher/lower than the generated number. The game continues under the user guessing the number.
The user has 6 attempts and the points are based on the number of attempts and the score is displayed once the game is completed.
